# 0x0B. Unity - VR Room

Welcome to this VR Escape Room! In this game you are thrust into a futuristic space station and need to solve the (admittedly easy) puzzle in order to escape! Will you survive? Yes, the answer is yes. It really is pretty easy, but this is the first thing I've ever made in VR so it's actually kind of incredible (to me) too. Hope you enjoy!

This VR Escape Room is designed to be used with the Oculus Quest and was created using Unity.

### About Me
Hi! My name is Marc and I'm learning software development for virtual and augmented reality. This virtual escape room is a project at the institution where I'm learning these new things. Boy oh boy it was a big challenge, but it has been my favorite coding project so far!

I'm interested in creative pursuits using this technology, especially in conjunction with music. [Click here](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3Ov3QDJuqhsunNjmn5BBEY?si=Yzj2mgZXSfqL9z7CxR--5g) if you'd like to listen to my band [The Jolly Llamas](jollyllamas.com).
